# AFI_CustomerRegistration.API
Registration API as part of recruitement process

It will be used for an API project that only creates customer details within a form of database - aiming for Azure SQL.

Validation will be done on the model - although I expect that there may be some required in the DBContext controller. Also the SQL will be run using
SQL statements rather than LINQ as I prefer to have more control over what is being done!
